# Final Solutions for Firestore NOT_FOUND Error

After extensive testing, here are the most reliable solutions to fix Firestore connectivity issues with the "NOT_FOUND" error:

## Solution 1: Delete and Recreate Your Database (Most Likely Solution)

According to the GitHub issue we found, the most common solution that worked for multiple people was:

1. **Delete your current Firestore database**
2. **Create a new database with the exact name "(default)"**

This seems to be a known issue with Firestore when users create a database with a custom name. The Firestore client libraries expect the database to be named "(default)" unless specified otherwise.

## Solution 2: Specify Database ID

If you don't want to delete your database, specify the database ID directly:

```javascript
// Method 1: For Firebase v9.18.0+
const db = getFirestore(app, '(default)');  // Try with your actual database name

// Method 2: For newer versions
const db = getFirestore(app, { databaseId: '(default)' });
```

Try different database ID values:
- "(default)"
- "default"
- "prod"
- "kitchensink"
- "kitchensink-c4872"
- Whatever your actual database is named in Firebase Console

## Solution 3: Update Firebase to Latest Version

Some versions of Firebase have fixes for database connection issues:

```bash
npm install firebase@latest
```

## Solution 4: Security Rules

Make sure your security rules allow read and write operations:

```
rules_version = '2';
service cloud.firestore {
  match /databases/{database}/documents {
    match /{document=**} {
      allow read, write: if true;  // Only for testing - restrict in production
    }
  }
}
```

## Solution 5: Use the Admin SDK (Most Reliable)

The Admin SDK bypasses security rules and generally has fewer connectivity issues:

1. Generate a service account key in Firebase Console → Project Settings → Service Accounts
2. Use the Admin SDK:

```javascript
const admin = require('firebase-admin');
const serviceAccount = require('./service-account.json');

admin.initializeApp({
  credential: admin.credential.cert(serviceAccount)
});

const db = admin.firestore();
```

## Solution 6: Check Database Region

Make sure your database region is properly specified. In the Firebase Console, check what region your Firestore database was created in and match it in code if needed.

## Solution 7: Use Firestore Emulator for Development

For local development, using the Firestore emulator often helps avoid these issues:

```bash
npm install -g firebase-tools
firebase init emulators
firebase emulators:start
```

Then connect to the emulator in your code:

```javascript
const { connectFirestoreEmulator } = require('firebase/firestore');
connectFirestoreEmulator(db, 'localhost', 8080);
```

## Solution 8: Create the Collection Manually

Sometimes, the collection needs to exist before you can write to it:

1. Go to Firebase Console → Firestore Database
2. Create the collection "test_collection" manually
3. Add a test document to it

## Conclusion

The most common solution for this issue is deleting and recreating the database with the name "(default)" as mentioned in Solution 1. If you continue having issues, please consider opening a support ticket with Firebase directly.
